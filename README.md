# musical-spork

This is one of my first projects.

The project is simply a music app made in python using tkinter and pygame.

How to use the app:
After downloading the project, go into the PlayLists folder And create new folders for your
music, and put your music files in there. After doing that you can run the app (MusicApp.py).

In the app you can expand the window and there choose one of the playlists you want to play that are 
in the PlayLists folder. In the main window of the app, you can:

1. Skip songs in the current playing playlist.

2.play, pause and unpause any song in the current playing playlist.

3.turn the volume up or down.

Again, this is one of my very first projects, so I'm looking for ways to improve it.
Any comments about the project will be welcomed

NOTE THAT the music files should be mp3 files
